# Smart OCR System

* Here is the solution of Smart OCR System

## Problem Identification and Solution:

* OCR is a technology that extracts all the text from the images, pdf documents or scanned files. So as opposed to entering the metadata of the documents manually, the OCR will identify the text in the documents which are fed into the document management system and send them to the database.
So instead of entering the metadata manually, the OCR does the job of extracting the text from the images, scanned files and other documents before sending them to the database.
